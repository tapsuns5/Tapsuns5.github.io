                                it took a lot longer than 100 days which isn’t part of the challenge but who cares. Made the commitment and
                                finished. The last few weeks I have really turned on the jets with accelerating my knowledge and shipping
                                things. I decided to end this with… <a href="https://t.co/McXngACA0b">https://t.co/McXngACA0b</a></p>&mdash;

                <section id="intro">
                    <p>Let me start off by saying that for years, I have told myself, &quot;I will learn how to
                        code,&quot; or I
                        kept telling myself and my wife, &quot;I want to learn how to code.&quot; The only thing
                        stopping me was
                        myself. Browsing around, I found the #100DaysofCodeChallenge on Twitter (now X) and began my
                        journey.
                        All I was missing was public accountability and a small commitment per day to learning with no
                        pressure. Here are my biggest takeaways from this experience that I want to share with you.
                    </p>

                <section id="Public-Acountability">
            </div>
            <div id="content">
                <h2>1. Public Accountability</h2>
                <p>For me, this was the start I needed. Find a community. Find people on the same journey as you and
                    connect with others. There is something about seeing people trying the same things you are doing.
                    You don't feel as alone when you are going through the struggles especially if it is your first time
                    jumping into code. You are most likely on this journey at the same time with other people who work a
                    full time job just like yourself.</p>

                <section id="Commit">
                    <h2>2. Commit to what you can, but commit</h2>
                    <p> I believe one of the rules of this challenge is to code for literally 100 days straight. I think
                        I did this for about 50 days until it wasn't really feasbile anymore. 50 days was quite the
                        accomplishment thought. My next 50 days took a lot longer than the first, but I am still here
                        writing to say I completed my 100 days. Life happens and you can't always control things, but
                        what is important is finishing your committment.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="Progress">
                    <h2>3. Progress Over Perfection</h2>
                    <p>I started with Codecademy's full stack course which began with HTML, CSS, and then moved to
                        vanilla Javascript. It wasn't until more advanced Javascript concepts did I start to hit some
                        roadblocks. It may have been because of the way I learn (everyone has their own ways) but I
                        struggled to retain some of the concepts before moving into React. The React course then became
                        a blur. Then the backend course became a blur once it jumped from NodeJS to ExpressJS. The most
                        important thing was to still keep moving forward and when things became difficult, I took a step
                        back and did more reading than actually trying to code. This will lead me to the next section.

                <section id="Projects">
                    <h2>4. Projects During Progress</h2>
                    <p>If you look at my twitter posts, I made the most progress probably the past 2-3 weeks. I was
                        taking things a bit too slow the last 25 days when I actually had a pretty solid understanding
                        of concepts and could start to mess around. I shipped things to GitHub and learned how to create
                        my bio here. I shipped a full stack application with PHP. I also created my first full stack JS
                        application with a MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS). It obviously took a lot of
                        google searching and working with ChatGPT but that is part fo the journey.</p>
                    <section id="End-Goal">
                        <h2>5. End Goal in Mind</h2>
                        <p>I firmly believe that learning how to code and build software is once fo the ways to not only
                            create value for yourself in the workplace but that it is a massive opportuntiy for you to
                            create financial freedom with your own business. Sure, you could hire someone to build your
                            product but not everyone has the capital to do so. Learning to code opens so many
                            opportunities for you. Which is why this topic is to have that end goal in mind. What do you
                            want to build? What problem do you want to solve?</p>

                    <section id="search-chat">
                        <h2>6. Search and Chat</h2>
                        <p> I have been in tech for the last 9 years and in Product the last 4. I am very accustomed to
                            tech and the concepts. I never could really grasp though the engineering and devloper memes
                            because I ahve never actually been in their shoes. Well, now I truly understand all the
                            stackoverflow memes and the google searching for code memes. It really is just part of the
                            craft. You understanding the concepts, you have the mindeset, but syntax always evolves and
                            you often work with many different languages. It takes 10,000 hours in order to master a
                            skill. Now, multiply that by the many langues you will need to know and the ever evolving
                            nature of syntax in coding. It is <strong>OKAY</strong> to google search and use AI engines
                            to help with your code. It is those that don't know how to use it that will get passed up.
                            Just make sure you understand the concepts and what that code is doing! It helps to rewrite
                            it yourself in your own code in a different feature in order to retain the information.</p>

                        <h2>7. &#128674; Ship Ship Ship &#128674;</h2>
                        <p> You don't really learn anything about buildig software until you ship your first website. It
                            could just be a page that says Hello World. Learning to code is much more that just writing
                            the code which is why this is title Ship!&#128674; Learning git, local development, file
                            structure, .env and .gitignore files for dev to prod deployments, handling local development
                            with database, remote databases and remote servers in general, and not to mention packages
                            and their dependeancies. I would reccomend anyone to try Codecademy and their course. I
                            thought it was decent. FreeCodeCamp is free and is also great. But nothing replaces shipping
                            things and getting your hands dirty to just FIO! (figure it out).</p>
