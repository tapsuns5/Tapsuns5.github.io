				#100DaysofCode Challenge
			</h1>

			<p>Let me start off by saying that for years, I have told myself, &quot;I will learn how to code,&quot; or I
				kept telling myself and my wife, &quot;I want to learn how to code.&quot; The only thing stopping me was
				myself. Browsing around, I found the #100DaysofCodeChallenge on Twitter (now X) and began my journey.
				All I was missing was public accountability and a small commitment per day to learning with no pressure.
			</p>
			<p>Here are my biggest takeaways from this experience that I want to share with you.</p>
			<h3>1. Public accountability is a driver.</h3>
			<p>For me, this was the start I needed. Find a community. Find people on the same journey as you and connect
				with others. There is something about seeing people trying the same things you are doing. You don't feel
				as alone when you are going through the struggles especially if it is your first time jumping into code.
			</p>
			<h3>2. Commit to what you can, but commit.</h3>
			<h3>3. Progress over perfection.</h3>
			<h3>4. Projects during progress.</h3>
			<h3>5. End goal in mind.</h3>
